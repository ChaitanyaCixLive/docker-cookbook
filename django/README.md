dockerfiles-sct-django
======================

if what you want is to run docker in development mode only need to run the container django, follow the instructions and when you launch the container do it as development mode

but if what you want is running in production mode docker you need to run django container first, not forgetting launch in production mode and then run nginx container, to make link

Do not forget that you can run the development environment and production in parallel if necessary
